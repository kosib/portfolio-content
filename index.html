		<p>Hey What's up? Thanks for coming on my blog-in-progress. 
		I'm actually a born and raised Trinidadian, from Malick Barataria. 
		From those humble beginnings, I went to UT Austin and studied Philosophy, where I espeically 
		loved the understanding of emotions and arguments. Now you may ask yourself how I got into 
		Information but we'll get to that in the next iteration. 
		</p>

		
		<p>In my free time I enjoy browsing through various books and exploring around my neighborhood. 
			I am a huge Steelers fan and I love Formula 1 racing. Also, I enjoy watching tv series and 
			movies such as Gossip Girl, Love Island and The Wire!</p>

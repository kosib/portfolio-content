		<p>Hey What's up? Thanks for coming on my blog-in-progress. 
		I'm actually a born and raised Trinidadian, from Malick Barataria. 
		From those humble beginnings, I went to UT Austin and studied Philosophy, where I espeically 
		loved the understanding of emotions and arguments. 
		I actually was a Philosophy major back in my undergrad. I did an Informatics course in my Sophmore year and fell in love with
		the field. From then I've done alot of projects for non profits and even big companies
		like Google!
		</p>

		
		<p>In my free time I enjoy browsing through various books and exploring around my neighborhood. 
			I am a huge Steelers fan and I love Formula 1 racing. Also, I enjoy watching tv series and 
			movies such as Gossip Girl, Love Island and The Wire! I am also a huge foodie, trying restaurantas all over the United States. If you check out my foodlife page,
			you'll see some cool highlights.
			I also am trying to increase my reading list for the eyar. If you guys got recommendations, fidn me on IG or Twitter @kosi_digital</p>

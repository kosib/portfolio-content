	<p>Have you guys seen what's happening with the Activision/Blizzard merger with Microsoft?
		Honestly its wild. While on my Discord server, I was discussing the rammifications with my friends.
		One made a great point, "video game companies stopped making innovation and instead started fighting throughexclusives." Is that 
		really healthy for the future of video games?<p>

	<p> We shall see in the coming years what this means for gaming. This acquisition by Microsoft has skyrocketed the gaming scetion of it
		to number 3 behind TenCent and Sony. Will there be more "content wars" over "console wars" in the future? We shall see.
		Speaking of console wars, Sony just bought Bungie, the former producer of Halo and home of MMO Destiny 2. 
		I don't know about you guys, but I'm a huge Destiny 2 fanboy. Seeing a big company buy my guys has me with mixed feelings. On one hand, there's the potential for a Destiny cinematic Universe!
		On the downside, they're in the pocket of a big company. I guess we shall see what the future holds.
